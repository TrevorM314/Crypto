# The Least Popular Branch Problem

## The Problem

Suppose there exists a selfish miner and the blockchain is configured to reward coins that average out to a constant time interval.

He will be incentivised to mine on the least popular branch in order to receive the largest portion possible of a chain's rewards.

## Conclusion

The coinbase reward must be directly tied to the mining difficulty of the block.
